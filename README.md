# Mapping_Earthquakes_
Javascript, Leaflet, VS Code, and Git Bash were used to create map visualizations on earthquake data around the world, focused specifically on the Californian west coast of the United States.

For purposes of the challenge code, all resources used were from official Leaflet documentation, class module examples, and https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/ for color hex codes.

Earthquake/tectonic plate API data taken from https://earthquake.usgs.gov as well as GEOJson data from https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/tree/master/GeoJSON.
